### Abstract
This thesis explores the integration of attention mechanisms within reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks. The objective is to enhance the decision-making capabilities of RL agents by focusing on relevant parts of the input data, thereby improving learning efficiency and performance. The study investigates various attention mechanisms, their implementation in RL, and their impact on complex environments.
